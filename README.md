# web-scraping-challenge
This repository contains the code files for a Mars web scraping project. The code scrapes the following webistes for news articles, information, and images of Mars:
1. https://redplanetscience.com/
2. https://spaceimages-mars.com
3. https://galaxyfacts-mars.com
4. https://marshemispheres.com/

The information is saved in a dictionary and uploaded to MongoDB.

The information is displayed on a website by using a Flask application. The website has a button that can be clicked to run the python code to scrape new information and update the display.

Code files and images of the website are included in this repository.
